### Hi there 👋

- I am interested in learning more about neurological disorders and treatment options for those suffering from them.
- I am currently working on finishing my neuroscience degree and pursuing research opportunities.
- I enjoy spending time with my animals, going on hikes, gardening and spending time with my friends.
